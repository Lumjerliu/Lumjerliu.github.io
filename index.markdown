  Welcome to my website! I am Lum Jerliu, a mathlete from Kosovo with a deep passion for Mathematics and Computer Science. I enjoy reading, particularly biographies, history, and science fiction. You can check out my Goodreads profile here.

  On this site, I aim to blog about topics that matter to me and share my insights with others. I hope you find the content valuable. Additionally, here are some other websites that have been instrumental in my personal development.
